## Techical Instructions

Both projects are built with Gradle 2.14. I've added the wrapper if you prefer not to download it.

Each project has a Main class with a main() method that can be executed to check the basic use case, but I recommend checking the test suite instead to have a more complete view of the functionality.

Executing `gradle build` command will run the tests and also generate CodeNarc reports. You can also execute `gradle gmetrics` to generate GMetrics reports and `gradle cobertura` for Cobertura reports.
